For this project three types of programs are used a sort, scan and focus program. All 3 of them 
access the memory in a different manner.

On an average the FIFO and the Custom page replacement, ie. Second Chance page replacement both are
giveing similar results on the above mentioned test programs, while the Random page replacement has
generally a higher page fault rate with some exceptions.

Graph for the page replacemt policies (with 100 pages):

Random:
                  
Page Faults             scan              sort           focus

Random page replacement in general will not give a good page replacement rate, because of its random 
nature some recently added pages may get replaced agian which will cause unnecessary page faults.
While the FIFO and Second Chance are different in theory but for the given experiment programs they
 seem to have similar results.

In all 3 page replacement policies we bring an page fom the disc only when the program explicitely 
asks for the page. If no empty frame is available then we remove some old frame to make space, thus
 we can say the code implements demand paging.
